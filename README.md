# Surfs_up

Overview

The goal of this challenge was to create a statistical analysis if the temperatures in Hawaii to determine if local shops should open year-round or seasonal.  I had to create queries for the months of June and December.  I had to get the average, maximum and minimum temperatures.    

Results

In June there were 1700 temperature counts between 2010 and 2017.  Looking at the standard deviation you can see that there are small differences in temperature throughout the years.  In December there is some missing data as there are less temperature counts from the same 2010-2017 time period.  The missing information is not large enough to ruin the results as there is about 89% of December information compared to June.  The temperatures in June and December are very similar, not much variation.  December is colder but not by much compared to June.

Summary

By looking at the temperatures from both the months of June and December we can conclude that the temperatures are relatively similar.  December is slightly colder on average but not by much.  The surf shop and ice cream shop owners should expect similar temperatures throughout the year.  
Two queries that could be used to determine if the business are sustainable year round are weather/precipitation queries.  They would determine how much precipitation per month.  The business owners can decide if it is worth staying open if depending on the precipitation.  Another query that could be useful is a wave size/speed chart with the tides.  If there is better surfing in summer months as opposed to winter months than that information would be useful to the business owners.
